### ToDos
- [x] HBS w/ JSON for templating styleguide foundation
- [x] Clean up assets/scss
- [ ] Clean up buttons
- [ ] Cherry pick mixins
- [ ] Missing BEM style syntax, e.g. .is-active
- [ ] Add full height section class flex
- [ ] Clean up gulpfile
- [ ] Clean up / merge config.js
- [ ] Clean up / merge package.json
- [ ] Look thru all gulp tasks
- [ ] Uncss?
- [ ] Styleguide w/ pages integration ( make a hbs version or integrate it within this starterkit? requires: global landing, page specific kits with each mod having a downloadable psd for client - should the SG be submodule like gulp version [would be easier, cleaner], or within proj repo - in which case there needs to be a sg dir )
- [ ] Test out separate pages within pages dir
- [ ] Figure out why vendor dir shows up in dist
